# Data structures and algorithm

This is a page where I'm testing and learning some algorithm.

## Implemented algorithms

* DFS (Depth First Search)
	* Implementation with `Stack`
	* Recursive version
* BFS (Breadth First Search)
	* Implementation with `Queue`
* Binary Search
* Sort
	* Bubble sort
	* Quick sort
	* Counting sort
* Fibonacci Sequence
	* Recursive Implementation
	* Implementation with `Queue`
